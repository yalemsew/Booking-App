### CS572-Final-Project-April-2024

This repository should be "Accepted/Forked" by team leaders only. One team member (team leader) will add their team member(s) as "collaborators" so they could collaborate and push their code to the same repository. Pair programming is encouraged. 

### Application specifications and requirements
It’s up to you to decide your project specs and requirements. Take your time to plan your project idea, write down a short description for it, set your goals, and have a clear scope. Your project must use the following:  
* Implement a login-based system with JWT.  
* All frontend add/update/delete actions or routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* All backend add/update/delete routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* Lazy-load the frontend routes, and follow a standard REST design in the backend.
* Both frontend and backend code must be safely typed, you are not allowed to use the explicit `any` type, nor the inferred implicit `any` type.
* Your frontend code must follow the latest Angular API specification, you are not allowed to use old practices.
* application global state and local state must be declared with signals. Derived states must use computed signals.
* Projects must have proper UI that complies with the web standards (use a UI Kit).
  
Note: Chat and product listing applications are not allowed.  
  
### Notes
* Before you write any code, and on the first day of the project, write a description of your project, and create a sketch of your UI screens and match them with a DB schema design, and call me to verify your DB design and application scope, once approved, you may start coding.
* You are not required to come to the classroom during the project. 
* I'm available to assist you every day through Teams from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM, and from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, except for Sunday. 
* I will create Team groups, students are expected to be available during class hours (above) on teams to receive occasional calls and check on their progress.
* A daily push is required to track your code contribution and performance. If you miss a push that will affect your final grade.
* Do not spend more than two hours on a problem, move on, or find an alternative.
      
### Technical Evaluation
The last push should be performed before Tuesday 9 pm. I will meet with every team individually on Wednesday and Thursday mornings and evaluate the final project code. Be prepared to answer tehcnical questions or make changes to your code.
     
Good luck and happy coding!
  
### Code Honor Submission Policy
All written code must be original. Presenting any code as one’s own work when it came from another source (copying code) is plagiarism, which includes any matching patterns and code snippets, and will affect your grade. The use of AI is not permitted in this project. For more details, check the full course policies in the syllabus.
